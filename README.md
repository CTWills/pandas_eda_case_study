# Setup
### Step 1
Make a directory to store the data called "youtube_data".
### Step 2
This program does an EDA using youtube data from kaggle. The data is too big to store on github.
Files to download from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new/data?select=USvideos.csv):
  1. USvideos.csv
  2. US_category_id.json\n
Move both of these files into the "youtube_data" folder
